    </p>
    <p>
        The Services are provided as a tool. How you choose to use this tool is entirely your decision and your responsibility. We make no representations about the suitability of the Services for any particular purpose or context.
    </p>

    <h2 id="s2">2. User Responsibilities and Compliance</h2>

        <li><strong>Consequences are your responsibility.</strong> We are not responsible for any consequences arising from your use of the Services, including but not limited to disqualification from hiring processes, termination of employment, academic penalties, reputational harm, civil liability, or criminal prosecution.</li>
        <li><strong>Ethical use is your responsibility.</strong> We neither encourage nor condone the use of the Services in any manner that would constitute dishonesty, cheating, fraud, or violation of any third party's rules or policies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="s3">3. Audio Recording and Screen Capture</h2>
    <p>The Services include audio recording and screen capture functionality. By using these features, you acknowledge and agree that:</p>

    <div class="critical-box">
        <h3>RECORDING CONSENT LAWS</h3>
        <p>
            Many jurisdictions have laws governing the recording of conversations, including "two-party consent" and "one-party consent" laws. <strong>You are solely responsible for understanding and complying with all applicable recording consent laws in your jurisdiction and the jurisdiction of any other party being recorded.</strong>
        </p>
    </div>

        <li>You will obtain all required consents before recording any audio, including system audio from calls, meetings, or conversations.</li>

        <li>You understand that recording video or voice calls may require the consent of all participants depending on applicable law.</li>
        <li>You will not use screen capture to capture or transmit proprietary, confidential, or copyrighted content belonging to third parties without authorization.</li>

    </ul>
