            <h3>⚖️ FINAL REMINDER</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>This App is a learning tool, NOT a cheating tool.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Using AI assistance during interviews misrepresents your abilities and is unfair to 
                other candidates. It can result in:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Immediate disqualification from job opportunities</li>
                <li>Damage to your professional reputation</li>
                <li>Legal consequences for fraud or misrepresentation</li>
                <li>Inability to perform the job you fraudulently obtained</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>Use this tool to LEARN and PREPARE, so you can succeed in interviews 
                through your own genuine skills.</strong>
